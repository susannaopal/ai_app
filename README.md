## Abstract

Our goal was to build a React app with Typescript and the PokeApi. Our app allows users to view pokemon by generation or all at once. Users can search for a pokemon by name and their search results will filter in real time. If a user clicks on a pokemon card it will show the user that pokemon's details. Users will also be able to favorite pokemon that will show up on a seperate `favorites` page.

## Technologies

- Javascript
- React
- React Hooks

## Wins

- App styling is on point.
- Our app functions the way we intended it to.
- Good communication and workflow.  

## Challenges + Improvements

- Learning a new language is difficult.
- Styling on favoriting button within the favorites view is not consistent (but the functionality is there!).
- Passing state around makes it difficult to keep track of the data used within different parts of the app.

## Future Iterations

- Comparison feature to compare type strengths and weaknesses between pokemon.
- The ability to search by properties other than name.
